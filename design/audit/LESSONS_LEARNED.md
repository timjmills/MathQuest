# Lessons learned — design it right the first time (2026-09-25)

Owner: "are we learning from these failures so that we can design better the first time?"

Every independent critic round so far (skills R3/R4, options R3, lessons R1) failed most work that the building
lane had self-graded 8. The failures fall into a small number of RECURRING classes. This file turns each class into
(1) a design rule applied BEFORE building, and (2) an automatic check, so it cannot recur silently.
**Every build and fix lane reads this file first and runs the PRE-FLIGHT checklist before it reports.**

## The recurring failure classes

| # | Class (seen in) | Design rule — do this first | Automatic check |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | **Size S ignored** — same grid and drawing at S as at L (options R3: 87 skills) | Every drawing sizes from `ctx.metrics` (never fixed mm/px); decide the S/M/L grids on paper before coding | `ws-columns` + NEW `--sizes` check: S must fit more items or more columns than L, drawings must scale |
| L2 | **Wasted space** — empty bands in cells, 1–3 items per page, blank page strips (R3, R4, options, lessons) | Size the cell to its content; count how many fit at S/M/L before building; mixed-height items get their own rows | `ws-print-lint` L-DENSITY H13 + PAGEFILL (on); run at S and L |
| L3 | **Answer given away** — result drawn (combine shapes), slot width = answer length, regroup boxes only where needed, labelled target tick, "wrong" answer = right answer | Structural scaffolds on EVERY item or none; slot widths from the widest possible answer; never draw what is asked | NEW lint: pupil page must not contain the key value inside the question drawing; providers-unit: wrong ≠ right |
| L4 | **Wrong or incoherent content** — unshaded "shaded" circles, axis 0, 1.8, 3.7…, carries on 1-digit facts, ungrammatical stories, "Up to 10" dealing 11–19 | Generate 50 items per option value and READ them before building the drawing; the name and each option value are promises | `ws-content-audit`, `ws-story-lint`, `ws-options-verify` predicates; add a predicate per new option |
| L5 | **Paper ≠ screen** — doubled answer areas, paper verbs on screen, MC on screen but writing on paper | One kit cell drawn on both; the cell's slots ARE the inputs; screen verbs via the contract map | `ws-screen-slots` (0 doubled, 0 paper verbs), `ws-screen-answer` |
| L6 | **Instructions / steps / titles don't follow the item** — guided steps for other numbers, "Write the missing numbers" on a hands task, place-value "I Can" on fractions | Derive instructions, steps, Say lines and titles FROM the item and chosen options (provider `stepsFor(q)`), never a fixed string per skill | NEW providers-unit check: every item's instruction/steps mention only its own numbers/task |
| L7 | **Legacy / colour cells** — old print path, colour, emoji, non-Andika fonts, scrollbars, bold headings in cells | New work goes straight to a kit cell; touching a legacy skill means migrating it | `ws-print-lint` INK / FONT / EMOJI; `ws-ink-unit` |
| L8 | **Options missing a dimension** — no support control where a hint could fade, no difficulty ladder, no appearance choice (options R3: O3 94, O2 84, O6 110 below 8) | Design the O1–O6 panel on paper first: one number-size ladder, one complexity control, one fading support, one appearance choice (or a one-sentence reason) | `ws-options-verify` (every value changes print + screen) |
| L9 | **Self-grades too generous** — lanes report 8, critics find 5–6 | Grade your own renders against the RUBRIC anchors with numbers measured (pixel-scan bands, count items, measure digit mm), not impressions; list every cap you checked | The ORCHESTRATOR runs an independent critic on a lane's renders BEFORE merge, not only after |
| L10 | **Answers follow a pattern or never vary** — correct choice alternates A/B or cycles every 3–5 items; one task answers the same on 30 of 30 items because two things are dealt by one draw (k2-r1) | Deal the answer position and every task attribute from the seeded rng with repeats allowed; never from `itemIndex % n`; one draw per independent attribute | NEW providers-unit / content-audit check: over 30 items the correct position and the answer must vary and must not cycle |
| L11 | **Steps squeezed beside the drawing** — a model / anchor cell's step list set in a strip one word per line, running out of its border, next to a tiny drawing in a huge cell (owner, count_by_tables anchor) | Steps go beside the drawing only when the column is ≥ 55 mm (≈ 18 characters); wide drawings (rows, lines, tables) always put steps underneath; the model cell is as tall as its content | print-lint: no text column < 18 characters per line, nothing outside its cell border |

## PRE-FLIGHT checklist (every lane, before reporting)
1. Rendered at **S and L** (and M if the grid differs): independent, guided, test, error-analysis + keys; card at
   1280/820/390, worksheet, quiz. Looked at every PNG.
2. For each page: items per page at S and L written down; largest empty band measured (must be < 30%); no page
   strip > 20% on Auto.
3. Read 50 generated items per option value: every item true to the skill name and the option's promise; the correct
   position and the answer vary with no cycle (L10).
4. Nothing in the question drawing reveals the answer; every structural scaffold on every item.
5. Instructions, steps, Say line and title checked against three different items.
6. Screen: one answer area, screen verbs, instant green, support ladder climbs.
7. Options: the panel has a size ladder, complexity control, fading support and an appearance choice (or a stated
   reason), all verified.
8. Gates green: the lane's usual list + `ws-screen-slots` + `ws-story-lint` (word skills).
9. Self-grade with numbers, and list which caps (H1–H13, OC1–OC15) you checked and why each does not apply.
