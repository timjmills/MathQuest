# Lessons learned — design it right the first time (2026-09-25)

Owner: "are we learning from these failures so that we can design better the first time?"

Every independent critic round so far (skills R3/R4, options R3, lessons R1) failed most work that the building
lane had self-graded 8. The failures fall into a small number of RECURRING classes. This file turns each class into
(1) a design rule applied BEFORE building, and (2) an automatic check, so it cannot recur silently.
**Every build and fix lane reads this file first and runs the PRE-FLIGHT checklist before it reports.**

## The recurring failure classes

| # | Class (seen in) | Design rule — do this first | Automatic check |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | **Size S ignored** — same grid and drawing at S as at L (options R3: 87 skills) | Every drawing sizes from `ctx.metrics` (never fixed mm/px); decide the S/M/L grids on paper before coding | `ws-columns` + NEW `--sizes` check: S must fit more items or more columns than L, drawings must scale |
| L2 | **Wasted space** — empty bands in cells, 1–3 items per page, blank page strips (R3, R4, options, lessons) | Size the cell to its content; count how many fit at S/M/L before building; mixed-height items get their own rows | `ws-print-lint` L-DENSITY H13 + PAGEFILL (on); run at S and L |
| L3 | **Answer given away** — result drawn (combine shapes), slot width = answer length, regroup boxes only where needed, labelled target tick, "wrong" answer = right answer | Structural scaffolds on EVERY item or none; slot widths from the widest possible answer; never draw what is asked | NEW lint: pupil page must not contain the key value inside the question drawing; providers-unit: wrong ≠ right |
| L4 | **Wrong or incoherent content** — unshaded "shaded" circles, axis 0, 1.8, 3.7…, carries on 1-digit facts, ungrammatical stories, "Up to 10" dealing 11–19 | Generate 50 items per option value and READ them before building the drawing; the name and each option value are promises | `ws-content-audit`, `ws-story-lint`, `ws-options-verify` predicates; add a predicate per new option |
| L5 | **Paper ≠ screen** — doubled answer areas, paper verbs on screen, MC on screen but writing on paper | One kit cell drawn on both; the cell's slots ARE the inputs; screen verbs via the contract map | `ws-screen-slots` (0 doubled, 0 paper verbs), `ws-screen-answer` |
| L6 | **Instructions / steps / titles don't follow the item** — guided steps for other numbers, "Write the missing numbers" on a hands task, place-value "I Can" on fractions | Derive instructions, steps, Say lines and titles FROM the item and chosen options (provider `stepsFor(q)`), never a fixed string per skill | NEW providers-unit check: every item's instruction/steps mention only its own numbers/task |
| L7 | **Legacy / colour cells** — old print path, colour, emoji, non-Andika fonts, scrollbars, bold headings in cells | New work goes straight to a kit cell; touching a legacy skill means migrating it | `ws-print-lint` INK / FONT / EMOJI; `ws-ink-unit` |
| L8 | **Options missing a dimension** — no support control where a hint could fade, no difficulty ladder, no appearance choice (options R3: O3 94, O2 84, O6 110 below 8) | Design the O1–O6 panel on paper first: one number-size ladder, one complexity control, one fading support, one appearance choice (or a one-sentence reason) | `ws-options-verify` (every value changes print + screen) |
| L9 | **Self-grades too generous** — lanes report 8, critics find 5–6 | Grade your own renders against the RUBRIC anchors with numbers measured (pixel-scan bands, count items, measure digit mm), not impressions; list every cap you checked | The ORCHESTRATOR runs an independent critic on a lane's renders BEFORE merge, not only after |
| L10 | **Answers follow a pattern or never vary** — correct choice alternates A/B or cycles every 3–5 items; one task answers the same on 30 of 30 items because two things are dealt by one draw (k2-r1) | Deal the answer position and every task attribute from the seeded rng with repeats allowed; never from `itemIndex % n`; one draw per independent attribute | NEW providers-unit / content-audit check: over 30 items the correct position and the answer must vary and must not cycle |
| L11 | **Steps squeezed beside the drawing** — a model / anchor cell's step list set in a strip one word per line, running out of its border, next to a tiny drawing in a huge cell (owner, count_by_tables anchor) | Steps go beside the drawing only when the column is ≥ 55 mm (≈ 18 characters); wide drawings (rows, lines, tables) always put steps underneath; the model cell is as tall as its content | print-lint: no text column < 18 characters per line, nothing outside its cell border |

> **2026-10-23:** the checks marked NEW above (L1 sizes, L3 key-in-drawing, L6 instruction-follows-item, L10 answer cycles) plus
> lone item / lone state, repeats, text ≠ generator and the Chromebook viewport are built in Wave 0 (`design/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`
> §1.4 S2), each proved by a backtest on a failed commit or a seeded fixture; `ws-precritic` then runs them before every critic round.

## Process rules (owner, 2026-10-23)

These rules come from `design/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` (§1.3 – §1.7, §4.3). The plan has the reasons; this is the short form.

1. **Template first.** Build in this order (§1.5): signed spec card → one model skill at Opus medium → full critic on
   every kind of worksheet, size (S / M / L) and screen host → golden renders saved → the template's other entries and
   presets as data at Opus low → batch critic (§1.3) → owner picture sheet → deploy.
   *Check:* the lane brief names the step it is on; nothing is copied onto a template before its model has passed.
2. **One approved model per (template, kind of worksheet) pair.** A pass on one pair says nothing about another. There is
   no inheritance across pairs (§1.6.2, §1.6.4).
   *Check:* a page counts as graded only as RUBRIC "How a page counts as graded" says.
3. **The spec card is signed before the build starts.** `node tests/scripts/ws-spec-card.mjs` writes
   `design/cards/<template>/<id>.md` with nine sections: 1 what it teaches · 2 problem types and progression ·
   3 the drawing · 4 rules that apply (by rule id) · 5 owner rulings · 6 misconceptions · 7 options and presets ·
   8 gates · 9 open questions. It ends with `Signed: owner, <date>` (§1.4 S3). Builders read the card; critics keep
   reading the full standards and RUBRIC.
   *Check:* `ws-spec-card --check-signed` passes before any build. `--check-coverage` (every rule id a critic has cited
   for the family is on the card) runs again at each build start, so a rule added after signing is caught.
4. **The order of checks is fixed** (§1.7):
   1. machine checks in node;
   2. machine checks in the browser;
   3. the builder's own look — catches plain faults, **never counts as a grade** (L9);
   4. critic reading (C1 and C2);
   5. full grade on all four criteria;
   6. the owner's look.

   A critic never sees a page whose machine checks are red. The builder's report is the `ws-precritic` table.
   *Check:* the orchestrator refuses a report without that table, and refuses it if any gate is red except where the
   pinned baseline is red.
5. **Flakes are defects.** A FAIL that passes when re-run alone is logged as a defect, with an owner, and counted in the
   S8 tally (`design/status/defect-tally.csv`) (§1.3).
   *Check:* the same item flaking twice blocks the deploy until it is fixed.
6. **Every critic finding is tallied by class** (classes in `design/status/defect-classes.md`, tally in S8).
   *Check:* a rising class that a machine can measure becomes the next machine check, proved by a backtest (§1.4 S2).
7. **Two rounds at medium, then stop.** If the same defect survives two rounds at Opus medium, stop the loop: find the
   root cause, make it a machine check, brief a fresh builder. Which profile builds what is in CLAUDE.md "Agents" (§1.7).
8. **Lane hygiene** (§1.4 S6, §1.6.6). A lane writes only `design/status/<lane>.md`, never `design/STATUS.md`. Its
   changes are listed in `design/lanes/<lane>/manifest.json`, applied by `ws-integrate` (once E5 lands). A lane never
   runs `ws-stamp-assets`. The owner's go for a family is the line `Owner go: <family>, <YYYY-MM-DD>` in the lane file
   (§1.6.3 step 6).
   *Check:* the deploy is refused for a family with no go line.

## PRE-FLIGHT checklist (every lane, before reporting)
1. Rendered at **S and L** (and M if the grid differs): independent, guided, test, error-analysis + keys; card at
   1280/820/390, worksheet, quiz. Looked at every PNG.
2. For each page: items per page at S and L written down; largest empty band measured (must be < 30%); no page
   strip > 20% on Auto.
3. Read 50 generated items per option value: every item true to the skill name and the option's promise; the correct
   position and the answer vary with no cycle (L10).
4. Nothing in the question drawing reveals the answer; every structural scaffold on every item.
5. Instructions, steps, Say line and title checked against three different items.
6. Screen: one answer area, screen verbs, instant green, support ladder climbs.
7. Options: the panel has a size ladder, complexity control, fading support and an appearance choice (or a stated
   reason), all verified.
8. Gates green: the lane's usual list + `ws-screen-slots` + `ws-story-lint` (word skills).
9. Self-grade with numbers, and list which caps (H1–H13, OC1–OC15) you checked and why each does not apply.
10. Paste the `ws-precritic` table in the report (once S1 lands; until then, the lane's gate list with each result).
